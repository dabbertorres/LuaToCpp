LuaToCpp
========

An ugly Lua to C++ translator.

What is this?
=============

So, I like Lua, and I like C++.
So I had the terrible idea to try and write a Lua parser.
I took that one step further and decided to translate the results into C++.

This is the result.

I'm sorry.

How to use
==========
There is little no error checking.
Anyways.
Run it, and give it two strings.
One being the input file (a Lua script)
and the second being the output file.

Then it runs and does its black magic.
